Version 0.5.0 (Under Development)
---------------------------------

This version release introduces a number of backward incompatible changes. Please read the below content carefully!

**Summary of changes**

- Minor cleanup that **may** break older code.
- Option to choose cash-game vs. tournament (default) mode (defaults to tournament mode).

  - Unlike in tourneys, in cash-games, players can select the number of runouts during all-in situations or opt to not show their hand after an all-in.

- Option to choose the number of runouts during all-in situations (disabled in tournament mode).

  - In theory, people choose number of runouts before they show their hands. But, this isn't always followed. It is also unclear who must select the number of runouts first. As such, after all-in, when showdown takes place, 

- Multi-board games.
- More degree of freedom in hole dealing/showdown order.
- Docstring and documentation overhaul.

**Changed**

- The parameters ``divmod``, and ``rake`` for relevant poker game/state initialization methods are now keyword-only arguments. Before, one could supply them as positional arguments but this is no longer allowed!
- ``pokerkit.state.State.board_cards`` (previously ``list[Card]``) is now of type ``list[list[Card]]``.

  - For example, if an all-in happens on the flop (AsKsQs) and is run twice (JsTs, JhTh), ``state.board_cards == [[As], [Ks], [Qs], [Js, Jh], [Ts, Th]]``. Or, when double board omaha is played, something like ``state.board_cards == [[??, ??], [??, ??], [??, ??]]`` will develop after the flop.
  - The function signatures for ``pokerkit.state.State.get_hand``, ``pokerkit.state.State.get_up_hand``, and ``pokerkit.state.State.get_up_hands`` now also requires the ``board_index`` to be supplied.
  - The properties/method ``pokerkit.state.State.reserved_cards``, ``pokerkit.state.State.cards_in_play``, ``pokerkit.state.State.cards_not_in_play``, and ``pokerkit.state.State.get_dealable_cards(deal_count: int)`` now return ``Iterator[Card]`` instead of ``tuple[Card, ...]``.
  - The method triplets for the hole dealing and showdown operation ``pokerkit.state.State.verify_hole_dealing()``, ``pokerkit.state.State.can_deal_hole()``, ``pokerkit.state.State.deal_hole()``, ``pokerkit.state.State.verify_hole_cards_showing_or_mucking()``, ``pokerkit.state.State.can_show_or_muck_hole_cards()``, and ``pokerkit.state.State.show_or_muck_hole_cards()`` also accepts an optional positional argument ``player_index`` to control the dealee, or the showdown performer. The verifiers also returns a player dealt if the dealee is not specified.

- The card-burning-related methods ``pokerkit.state.State.verify_card_burning``, ``pokerkit.state.State.can_burn_card``, and ``pokerkit.state.State.burn_card`` also accept a singleton card iterable.
- The ``pokerkit.state.State.all_in_show_status`` was renamed to ``pokerkit.state.State.all_in_status``.
- Renamed ``pokerkit.state.ChipsPushing.rake`` to ``pokerkit.state.ChipsPushing.raked_amount``.
- The attribute ``pokerkit.state.Pot.amount`` is now a property and no longer a parameter during initialization.

**Added**

- New enum class ``pokerkit.state.State.Mode`` for setting tournament/cash-game mode while initializing poker states.

  - Tournament mode: ``pokerkit.state.Mode.TOURNAMENT`` 
  - Cash-game mode: ``pokerkit.state.Mode.CASH_GAME``

    - In all-in situations, players have a chance to choose the number of runouts during showdown.

- New parameter ``mode`` in relevant poker game/state initialization methods. It defaults to tournament mode.
- New parameter ``starting_board_count`` in relevant poker game/state initialization methods. It defaults to ``1``. This allow multiple boards to be dealt if wished.
- New automation ``pokerkit.state.State.Automation.RUNOUT_COUNT_SELECTION`` which instructs PokerKit to carry out only one run-out.
- New ``pokerkit.state.RunoutCountSelection`` operation.

  - Arguments: ``runout_count`` and ``player_index`` who gives out the selection.
  - Querier: ``pokerkit.state.State.can_select_runout_count(player_index: int | None = None, runout_count: int | None = None)``.
  - Validator: ``pokerkit.state.State.verify_runout_count_selection(player_index: int | None = None, runout_count: int | None = None)``.
  - Operator: ``pokerkit.state.State.select_runout_count(player_index: int | None = None, runout_count: int | None = None, *, commentary: str | None = None)``.
  - People who can select run count: ``pokerkit.state.State.runout_count_selector_indices``.
  - If ``runout_count`` are in disagreement among active players, only ``1`` runout is performed.
  - When multiple runs are selected, the state will be incompatible with the PHH file format, as it stands.

- New attributes ``pokerkit.state.State.street_return_index`` and ``pokerkit.state.State.street_return_count`` that internally keeps track what street to return to and how many times to do so during multiple runouts.
- New attribute ``pokerkit.state.State.runout_count`` that shows the players' preferences on the number of runouts. It maybe ``None`` in which case the runout selection was skipped due to the state being of tournament mode or all players showed no preference by passing in ``None`` (or leaving empty) for the ``runout_count`` argument during the corresponding method call of ``pokerkit.state.select_runout_count()``.
- New attributes ``pokerkit.state.State.board_count`` and ``pokerkit.state.State.board_indices`` on the number of boards and the range of its indices. The number of boards is at least ``1`` but may be more due to multiple runouts or the variant being played.
- New method ``pokerkit.state.State.get_board_cards(board_index: int)`` on getting the ``board_index``'th board.

  - The maximum number of boards is either equal to the number of boards of the variant or (in case of multiple runouts) the product of it and the number of runouts.

- New attribute ``pokerkit.state.State.runout_count_selector_statuses`` that keeps track of who can select the number of runouts.
- New attribute ``pokerkit.state.State.runout_count_selection_flag`` that keeps track of whether the runout count selection has been carried out.
- In ``pokerkit.utilities.rake``, added parameters ``state``, ``cap``, and ``no_flop_no_drop``, and ``rake`` is now renamed as ``percentage`` and is a keyword parameter.
- New attributes ``pokerkit.state.Pot.raked_amount`` and ``pokerkit.state.Pot.unraked_amount`` that gives the raked and the unraked amounts of the pot.
- New property ``pokerkit.state.ChipsPushing.unraked_amount``.
