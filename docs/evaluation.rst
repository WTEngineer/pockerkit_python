Hand Evaluation
===============

Not every poker software involve game simulations. Beyond its use of providing
a simulated poker environment, PokerKit serves as a valuable resource for
evaluating poker hands. It supports the largest selection of hand types in any
mainstream open-source poker library. This makes it an invaluable tool for users
interested in studying the statistical properties of poker, regardless of their
interest in game simulations.

- Badugi hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.BadugiHand`
- 8 or better low hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.EightOrBetterLowHand`
- Greek hold'em hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.GreekHoldemHand`
- Kuhn poker hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.KuhnPokerHand`
- Omaha 8 or better low hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.OmahaEightOrBetterLowHand`
- Omaha hold'em hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.OmahaHoldemHand`
- Regular low hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.RegularLowHand`
- Short-deck hold'em hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.ShortDeckHoldemHand`
- Standard high hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.StandardHighHand`
- Standard low hands: :class:`pokerkit.hands.StandardLowHand`

Standard high hands are used for games like Texas hold'em. When something
contains ``low`` it means it is a low hand. Lots of these types have the same
base lookup. They just differ in the way the hands are evaluated. For example,
Standard high hands and Omaha hold'em hands uses the same lookup.

Our hand evaluators are optimized for speed while giving a convenient high
level interface.

Creating Hands
--------------

There are two ways of creating hands. They are both very straight forward.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from pokerkit import *
   >>> h0 = ShortDeckHoldemHand('6s7s8s9sTs')
   >>> h1 = ShortDeckHoldemHand('7c8c9cTcJc')
   >>> h2 = ShortDeckHoldemHand('2c2d2h2s3h')
   Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
   ValueError: invalid hand '2c2d2h2s3h'
   >>> h0
   6s7s8s9sTs
   >>> h1
   7c8c9cTcJc

What if you want to evaluate hands from a game setting? No problem.

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> from pokerkit import *
   >>> h0 = OmahaHoldemHand.from_game('6c7c8c9c', '8s9sTc')
   >>> h1 = OmahaHoldemHand('6c7c8s9sTc')
   >>> h0 == h1
   True
   >>> h0 = OmahaEightOrBetterLowHand.from_game('As2s3s4s', '2c3c4c5c6c')
   >>> h1 = OmahaEightOrBetterLowHand('Ad2d3d4d5d')
   >>> h0 == h1
   True
   >>> hole = 'AsAc'
   >>> board = 'Kh3sAdAh'
   >>> hand = StandardHighHand.from_game(hole, board)
   >>> hand.cards
   (As, Ac, Kh, Ad, Ah)

Comparing Hands
---------------

First, let us realize that stronger or weaker hands do not necessarily always
mean higher or lower hands. In some variants, lower hands are considered
stronger, and vice versa.

Comparing the hand strengths is quite simple... Just compare them!

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> h0 = StandardHighHand('7c5d4h3s2c')
   >>> h1 = StandardHighHand('7c6d4h3s2c')
   >>> h2 = StandardHighHand('8c7d6h4s2c')
   >>> h3 = StandardHighHand('AcAsAd2s4s')
   >>> h4 = StandardHighHand('TsJsQsKsAs')
   >>> h0 < h1 < h2 < h3 < h4
   True
   >>> h0 = StandardLowHand('TsJsQsKsAs')
   >>> h1 = StandardLowHand('AcAsAd2s4s')
   >>> h2 = StandardLowHand('8c7d6h4s2c')
   >>> h3 = StandardLowHand('7c6d4h3s2c')
   >>> h4 = StandardLowHand('7c5d4h3s2c')
   >>> h0 < h1 < h2 < h3 < h4
   True

Algorithm
---------

The library generates a lookup table for each hand type. The hands are generated
in the order or reverse order of strength and assigned indices, which are used
to compare hands. High-level interfaces allow users to construct hands by
passing in the necessary cards and using standard comparison operators to
compare the hand strengths. It's worth noting that "strength" in poker hands
does not necessarily mean "low" or "high" hands. Each hand type in PokerKit
handles this distinction internally, making it transparent to the end user.

In the lookup process, cards are converted into unique integers that represent
their ranks. Each rank corresponds to a unique prime number and the converted
integers are multiplied together. The suitedness of the cards is then checked.
Using the product and the suitedness, the library looks for the matching hand
entries which are then used to compare hands.
