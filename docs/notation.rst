Examples
--------

A large dataset of hand histories are available on `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10796886>`__. One of the hands, played by Dwan and Ivey, is shown below:

.. code-block:: toml

   # The first televised million-dollar pot between Tom Dwan and Phil Ivey.
   # Link: https://youtu.be/GnxFohpljqM
   
   variant = "NT"
   ante_trimming_status = true
   antes = [500, 500, 500]
   blinds_or_straddles = [1000, 2000, 0]
   min_bet = 2000
   starting_stacks = [1125600, 2000000, 553500]
   actions = [
     # Pre-flop
   
     "d dh p1 Ac2d",  # Ivey
     "d dh p2 ????",  # Antonius
     "d dh p3 7h6h",  # Dwan

   ]
   author = "Juho Kim"
   event = "Full Tilt Million Dollar Cash Game S4E12"
   year = 2009
   players = ["Phil Ivey", "Patrik Antonius", "Tom Dwan"]
   currency = "USD"

Interactions
------------

The PokerKit library features PHH file format reader and writer utilities. It offers "load" and "dump" programmatic APIs akin to those provided by Python's standard libraries such as "json," and "pickle". Below are sample usages of the PHH file format utilities in PokerKit. The hand history object in Python serves as an iterator of the corresponding poker state which first yields the initial state, followed by the same state after applying each action one-by-one in the “actions” field. From game and state objects that are interacted with programmatically, the hand history object can also be created which can subsequently be saved in the file system.

Reading hands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from pokerkit import *

   # Hand loading
   with open("...", "rb") as file:
       hh = HandHistory.load(file)

   # Create game
   game = hh.create_game()

   # Create state
   state = hh.create_state()

   # Iterate through each action step
   for state in hh:
       ...

   # Iterate through each action step
   for state, action in hh.iter_state_actions():
       ...

It is possible to supply your own chip value parsing function, divmod, or rake function to construct the game states.

.. code-block:: python

   from pokerkit import *

   hh = HandHistory.load(
       ...,
       automations=...,
       divmod=...,
       rake=...,
       parse_value=...,
   )

   hh = HandHistory.loads(
       ...,
       automations=...,
       divmod=...,
       rake=...,
       parse_value=...,
   )

The default value parsing function, also supplied as ``parse_float`` to TOML loading functions in Python, is defined as :func:`pokerkit.utilities.parse_value` and automatically parses integers or floats based on the raw string value. You may supply your own number type parsers.

Writing Hands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

   from pokerkit import *

   # Game state construction
   game = PotLimitOmahaHoldem(
       (
           Automation.ANTE_POSTING,
           Automation.BET_COLLECTION,
           Automation.BLIND_OR_STRADDLE_POSTING,
           Automation.CARD_BURNING,
           Automation.HOLE_CARDS_SHOWING_OR_MUCKING,
           Automation.HAND_KILLING,
           Automation.CHIPS_PUSHING,
           Automation.CHIPS_PULLING,
       ),
       True,
       0,
       (500, 1000),
       1000,
   )
   state = game((1259450.25, 678473.5), 2)

   # State progression; Pre-flop
   state.deal_hole("Ah3sKsKh")  # Antonius
   state.deal_hole("6d9s7d8h")  # Blom
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(3000)  # Blom
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(9000)  # Antonius
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(27000)  # Blom
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(81000)  # Antonius
   state.check_or_call()  # Blom

   # Flop
   state.deal_board("4s5c2h")
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(91000)  # Antonius
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(435000)  # Blom
   state.complete_bet_or_raise_to(779000)  # Antonius
   state.check_or_call()  # Blom

   # Turn & River
   state.deal_board("5h")
   state.deal_board("9c")

   # Creating hand history
   hh = HandHistory.from_game_state(game, state)
   hh.players = ["Patrik Antonius", "Viktor Blom"]

   # Dump hand
   with open("...", "wb") as file:
       hh.dump(file)
