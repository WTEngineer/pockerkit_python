Here are some of the features that are planned to be implemented in the future.

- Post bets support.

  - Post bets are posted when a player wants to play a game immediately after
    joining without waiting for the button to pass him or her.
  - This is demonstrably different from blinds or straddles
  - As an optional parameter

- Unknown stacks support.

  - One can pass ``math.inf`` as the unknown starting stack.

- Fully comply with the Poker Hand History file format specs.

  - Add mock games to unit test for each variant.

- Improved type annotations.

  - The code supports both ``int`` and ``float`` but type annotations for static
    type checking only support ``int``.

- Sandbox mode

  - Do not care about errors
